# illumos Project Discussion

This repository is a preliminary holding area for a new shrink-to-fit process
for collaboration on larger scale illumos projects.  This README itself will
get fleshed out soon, but in the meantime there is a table of initial IPD
(illumos project discussion) documents below:
